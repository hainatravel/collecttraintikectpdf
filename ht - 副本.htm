  <h3 align="left">1. Timing for ticket  collection</h3>
  <p align="left">  Be prepared. Boy Scout’s motto applies here,  too. Keep in mind that you have paper ticket(s) to collect while packing up. It  is much wiser to get your paper ticket(s) at <strong>least 3 hours prior to the departure time</strong> than doing it the last  minute. And mind the <strong>business hours</strong>:  windows for ticket collection at railway stations are open from 08:00 to 22:00.  Ticket agents (代售点) are  not for collecting.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;At some railway stations, security check is required before you can enter the actual building of the station and collect the train tickets. You might be asked to be scanned with an X-ray scanner at the entrance of the station square but it is unlikely that they will ask for your ID certificates or train tickets. </p>
  <h3 align="left">2. Two things in hand </h3>
  <p>Each  successfully-issued booking comes with a certain pick-up number. If you have  multiple bookings coming up, you will receive different pick-up numbers for  each booking. You will find it at the beginning of this email. With the <strong>pick-up number and your passport</strong>, you  can go and collect your ticket(s) at any railway station or ticket office.  Writing down the pick-up number on a paper or a printed-out copy will be  helpful.  </p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" width="642" height="167" src="howTo_clip_image002.jpg" /></p>
  <h3 align="left">3. Find the ticket  collection window at a railway station </h3>
  <p align="left">There will be a lot of ticket  windows at a railway station. This might sound surprising but only a few of  them are open for ticket collection. So firstly you need to find the right  window for ticket collection. This kind of windows are often signed as “电话订票、网络订票取票窗口 (Ticket  collection window for telephone and online bookings)”. Show your passport(s)  and pick-up number(s) to the counter clerk and she/he will hand over the paper  ticket(s). Always keep your passport(s) and ticket(s) safe. </p>
  <p align="left">Note: China Highlights has manual checking during the issuing of the tickets as a way to prevent mistakes. However, as slight as it can be (perhaps 1 in 10,000), there can still be a chance that you cannot collect train tickets at the ticket counter (reasons can be China Rail’s system being upgraded, or rookie ticket clerk etc). In such case, the best move that we suggest is to show the screenshot of ticket issued to the clerk (Screenshot of ticket issued can be found in the confirmation email); or contact us immediately by phone and we will talk to the clerk for solution. 
    To avoid unnecessary loss, this situation shall be fixed right away before the departure time.  Please understand there is nothing that we can do if you contact us after the train’s gone. China Highlights shoulders no responsibility for failed ticket collecting due to improper handling beyond our account.</p>
  <p align="left"> To find the right window, show this  sentence to any station staffer or by-passer:</p>

  <h2><a name="board_train" id="board_train"></a><a name="Part-2_How_to" id="Part-2_How_to"></a>Part-2 How to board a train </h2>
  <h3>1. Make sure you have everything ready </h3>
  <p align="left">  <strong>Your  passport(s) and paper ticket(s) </strong>are the two essential things for boarding,  coming along with your luggage and other stuff. You will need to present paper  ticket(s) twice before boarding: firstly at security check and then at ticket  checking. Only once for your passport(s), at security check. Putting your  passport(s) in a fanny pack or mini bag can be handy; however, you shall always  keep it safe after checking’s done. <br />
    Dining on train, no matter a bento or  made-to-order meals in the dining car, is hardly the same as eating in a  restaurant. For long-distance travel, we suggest you bring some food, cookies,  instant noodles, fruits or some drinks. What’s more, there’s no toilet paper,  disposable toilet seat cover or flip-flops offered on train, better pack them  up if needed.   </p>
  <h3>2. Pass the security check </h3>
  <p align="left">Security check is  required before entering the waiting hall, which at some stations even happens  before entering the station building. Station staffers will scan you with an  X-ray device and your luggage will go through a scanning machine.  Comparatively, security check is less hassle and tough than that at the  airport. For example, common liquid items will not be banned and lighters can  be brought onto the train. <br />
    Things that are not  allowed to take in: firearms (guns, knives, ammunition of any caliber in any  quantity etc), explosives (including fireworks and pyrotechnics) and imitation  explosives or devices, items containing incapacitating gases, liquids or other  substances (including CS gas sprays), inflammable substances except in minimal  quantities (eg. lighters), butane gas, any items that are prohibited or limited  by the government, live animals and insects and anything that can do harm to  other passengers and public hygiene. Luggage that exceeds the limitation of the  regulation shall not be brought onto train either. </p>
  <h3>3. Find the right place to wait </h3>
  <p align="left">The waiting hall is  the place to wait for boarding. Most stations have divided waiting sections for  different trains, some have all the passengers waiting in a big hall with just  the ticket check specially signed differently. For most high speed trains, the  appointed waiting section are stated on the paper tickets (see picture of  example). </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="543" height="206" src="howTo_clip_image006.jpg" alt="dddd.jpg" /><br />
    <img border="0" width="500" height="166" src="howTo_clip_image007.jpg" alt="未标题-2.jpg" /> </p>
  <p align="left"><br />
    Otherwise, you will  need some direction for the right waiting place. A LED screen will have waiting  section of each train displayed on a scroll. When you get to a certain waiting  section, there will probably be a sign saying “XXX train waiting section (xxx次列车在此候车) ” (See  picture of example) </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="571" height="249" src="howTo_clip_image009.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
    To find your  waiting section, show this sentence to any train staffer or by-passer, along  with your ticket(s): </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>我搭乘这趟火车，请问我的候车室在哪里？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> wǒ dā    chéng zhè tàng huǒ chē, qǐng wèn wǒ de hòu chē shì zài nǎ lǐ?<br />
        (I am taking this    train; would you please tell me where the waiting hall is?) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>4. Have your ticket(s) checked </h3>
  <p align="left"><strong>Ticket  checking stops 5 minutes before the departure time</strong>. Make sure you get  everything at the ready before checking. Ticket barriers at the exit of every  waiting section link to the boarding platform. Normally there is a LED screen  above the barrier telling what the current situation is: waiting (正在候车),  ticket checking (正在检票),  ticket checking over (停止检票). <br />
    People tend to get  antsy once “ticket checking” is on but knowing where you are heading is  important: holding <strong>blue-colored paper  ticket</strong>, you shall pass through the automatic checking machine; the<strong> red-colored ones</strong> are to those ticket  inspectors and get pinched by a pair of ticket scissors. Put away your  ticket(s) once checking’s done.<br />
    At some railway  stations, waiting sections are not always divided. In this case, show this  sentence to any station staffer or by-passer, while showing your ticket(s), to  find your waiting line: </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>我搭乘这趟列车，请问我在哪里候车？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> wǒ dā    chéng zhè tàng liè chē, qǐng wèn wǒ zài nǎ lǐ hòu chē<br />
        (I am taking this    train; would you please tell me where the waiting section is?) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>5. Get onto the platform </h3>
  <p align="left">Under some special  circumstances, you might need to walk up and down stairs to get onto the  platform. At some recently-built or renovated stations, escalator and elevator  will make this walk easier for senior travelers or ones with large luggage. A  LED screen will show direction of your designated platform by highlighting the  train number, indicating which stair to walk down or which way to head. </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="567" height="274" src="howTo_clip_image011.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
    Unlike that in  Europe, boarding platforms in China don’t have gates. Keep an eye on your  children while traveling with kids. There will probably be two trains by both  sides of one platform. Board the one that its number matches your paper ticket.  Ticket inspectors who stand by the gates of different cars will request for  ticket check, ID checking is not necessary. Double check with them in case you  are not sure if it’s your train. </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="560" height="247" src="howTo_clip_image013.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>6. Officially on board </h3>
  <p align="left">To <strong>find your designated car and seat</strong>, you  will need to check the details on the paper ticket. Below is an example picture  telling you how to read a ticket.</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="642" height="707" src="howTo_clip_image015.jpg" /> </p>
  <p align="left"><br />
    If you are taking  large luggage, the first thing after boarding shall be finding a place for your  stuff. There is a luggage place at the connected parts of two cars on a high  speed train, which can store 2 to 4 suitcases on its two-leveled shelf. This  public shelf is not for reservation, rather like first-come-first-served. You  can also stow luggage on the upper shelf by the seat (See below )</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="643" height="302" src="howTo_clip_image017.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
    if the public shelf  is fully occupied. Valuable belongings shall always be with you.  <br />
    You might need  these sentences when looking for your seat or would like to change seats with  others: </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        (1) <strong>请问我的座位在哪里？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> qǐng    wèn wǒ de    zuò wèi zài nǎ lǐ ? <br />
        (Where is my seat, please? (While showing    your tickets) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><p align="left">(2) <strong>对不起，我和我的同伴座位不在一起，请问你是否愿意和我们换一下座位？</strong> <br />
          <strong>Pinyin: </strong>duì bú qǐ, wǒ hé wǒ de tóng bàn zuò wèi bú zài yī qǐ, qǐng    wèn nǐ shì    fǒu    yuàn yì hé wǒ men    huàn yī xià zuò wèi ?<br />
          (Excuse me, my friends and I are in    separated seats, would you mind changing seats with us?) </p></td>

  <h2>Part-3 Travel tips </h2>
  <h3>1. Safety</h3>
  <p align="left">Traveling by train  in China is fairly safe. However, like other travel styles by air or barefoot, this  advantage can be blunted if safety awareness doesn’t come a priority. Here are  some tips for train travel safety. <br />
    (1) Be advised that  you shall always keep your belongings within your eyesight and never leave  valuable items out in the open. Your cash, credit cards, travel documents and  other important items shall be separated and keep them safe. Normally, a small  amount of cash, about 100RMB, is far beyond enough for needs on the train (e.g.  food and other stuff). Have some small bills handy so that you don’t have to  grub in your bags or luggage. <br />
    (2) Traveling with  young kids, it is the adults’ job to restrain them from getting too excited  about everything, for they may run around on the platform and the car, or  fiddle about the bathroom doors or water faucet. Normally the stations don’t  have special pass or boarding platforms for senior travelers, but it is  unlikely a senior will be jostled and pushed. Aside from the high speed trains  that are galloping steadily, senior travelers may avoid walking around on the  train as sometimes harsh jarring and sudden braking can happen. <br />
    (3) Tapping water  is not for drinking. Always drink bottled water or get water at the drinking  pantry. Let your children know this before they ask for a drink. <br />
    (4) Keeping your wits  about you might be easy during daytime or short routes. There are chances that  things get stolen or lost for some overnight train rides. Use the code lock on  your suitcase. If your bag or rucksack has a strap, clip it up onto the railing  by the bunk or your arm before you go to sleep. This will wake you up at every  single movement of the bag or rucksack. Stash your money, cards and travel  documents inside your jacket and zip it up. Of course, lock up the compartment  if possible.  </p>
 
 <h3>2. Limited of the luggage </h3>
  <p align="left">
In theory, the luggage limit on Chinese trains is 20 kg for adults, 10 kg for children. No one, however, weighs or measures your bags, so if your luggage goes through the security check, you'll be fine. If you really want to transport vast quantities of luggage, you can purchase baggage tickets for bags in excess of the official limits.
  </p>
  
 <h3>3. Red-cap porter service </h3>
  <p align="left"> 
  If you take heavy luggage or a big suitcase with you, you might want to find the red-cap porters at the train station to help you carry your luggage onto the train. Each piece will cost about 10 to 20 yuan.
  </p>
  <h3>4. The loo</h3>
  <p align="left">All the regular  non-high-speed trains are equipped Japanese-style squat toilets while all the  high speed trains are western-style. The bathrooms are located at both ends of  every car. Note that they will be temporarily closed 10 minutes before the  train reaches a station and during the time it stays at that station. So just  go whenever nature calls coz you don’t know when it’s going to reach a station.  And there will probably be a long waiting line, too. <br />
    On high speed  trains, used tissues and other wastes shall be put into the trash can. However,  on non-high-speed ones, tissue and other wastes can be flushed down by treading  on a pedal. Always taking valuable things with you, you can put them at the  hook of the back of the door while using the toilet. <br />
    Bathrooms on high  speed trains have disposable paper seat cover and tissues. In the washroom,  there are soap (or liquid soap) and wiping paper. Ask a steward for refill if  they are used up. None of these things are offered on those regular  non-high-speed trains. Be mentally prepared since the squatted toilets can be  really nasty for those long-haul trains. Thus, a pack of baby wipes or hand  sterilizer and some tissues should be in your packing list. <br />
    Young kids and  senior travelers are advised to have guardian around while using the toilet.  Senior travelers shall use the hand railing inside the bathroom. And be careful  of the slamming door pinching fingers. Floors can be slippery at times, watch  your steps and walk slowly. </p>
  <h3>5. Ready to get off </h3>
  <p align="left">It is better to get  ready in advance when the train is slowly pulling off at the destination. Ask  for help from the steward, you can use this sentence: </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>请在到站前</strong><strong>10</strong><strong>分钟提醒我准备下车，谢谢！</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin: </strong>qǐng zài dào zhàn qián 10fèn zhōng tí xǐng wǒ zhǔn bèi    xià chē, xiè xiè!<br />
        (Please    remind me 10 minutes before arrive my destination, thanks!) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Gather  your stuff before getting off and don’t forget your ticket(s) because you might  encounter another ticket check at the exit. </p>
