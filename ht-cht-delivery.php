  <h2><a name="board_train" id="board_train"></a><a name="Part-1_How_to" id="Part-1_How_to"></a>Part-1 How to board a train </h2>
  <h3>1. Make sure you have everything ready </h3>
  <p align="left">  <strong>Your  passport(s) and paper ticket(s) </strong>are the two essential things for boarding, along with your luggage and other stuff. You will need to present paper ticket(s) twice before boarding: first at the security check and then at the ticket check, and passport(s) only once, at the security check.   </p>
  <p>Putting your passport(s) in a fanny pack or mini bag can be handy. You should always be careful to keep it safe after checking.</p>
  <p>Dining on a train, no matter whether a snack from the trolley or a made-to-order meal in the dining car, is hardly the same as eating in a restaurant. For long-distance travel, we suggest you bring some food, cookies, instant noodles, fruit and drink. </p>
  <p>What’s more, there’s no toilet paper, disposable toilet seat covers or flip-flops on trains, so better pack them if required.</p>
  <h3>2. Pass the security check </h3>
  <p align="left">A security check is required before entering the waiting hall, which at some stations even happens before entering the station building. Station staff will scan you with an X-ray device and your luggage will go through a scanning machine. </p>
  <p align="left">The check is less hassle and easier than that at the airport. For example, common liquid items are not banned and lighters can be brought onto the train.</p>
  <p align="left">Prohibited things that are not allowed to take in: firearms (guns, knives, or ammunition, etc), explosives (including fireworks and pyrotechnics) and imitation explosives or devices, items containing incapacitating gases, liquids or other substances (including CS gas sprays), inflammable substances except in minimal quantities (eg. lighters), butane gas, any items that are prohibited or limited by the government, live animals and insects or anything that can do harm to other passengers and public hygiene. </p>
  <p align="left">Excess luggage (exceeding the regulation limitations) should not be brought onto the train either.</p>
  <h3>3. Find the right place to wait </h3>
  <p align="left">The waiting hall is where you wait for boarding. Most stations have different waiting sections for different trains, but some have all passengers waiting in a big hall. For most high-speed trains, the appointed waiting section is stated on the paper ticket (see examples in the pictures below).</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="543" height="206" src="howTo_clip_image006.jpg" alt="dddd.jpg" /><br />
    <img border="0" width="500" height="166" src="howTo_clip_image007.jpg" alt="未标题-2.jpg" /> </p>
  <p align="left"><br />
  Otherwise, you will need to seek directions to the right waiting place. A LED screen will have the waiting section for each train displayed on a scroll. When you get to a certain waiting area, there will probably be a sign saying “XXX train waiting section (xxx次列车在此候车) ” (See the photographs below for examples) </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="571" height="249" src="howTo_clip_image009.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
  To find your waiting section, show this sentence to any station worker or passer-by, along with your ticket(s): </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>我搭乘这趟火车，请问我的候车室在哪里？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> wǒ dā    chéng zhè tàng huǒ chē, qǐng wèn wǒ de hòu chē shì zài nǎ lǐ?<br />
        (I am taking this    train; would you please tell me where the waiting hall is?) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>4. Have your ticket(s) checked </h3>
  <p align="left"><strong>Ticket  checking stops 5 minutes before the departure time</strong>. Make sure you get everything ready before checking. Ticket barriers at the exit of every waiting section link to the boarding platform. Normally there is a LED screen above the barrier telling what the current situation is: waiting (正在候车), ticket checking (正在检票), ticket checking over (停止检票).</p>
  <p>People tend to get anxious once “ticket checking” has begun, but knowing where you are heading should help: with a blue-colored paper ticket, you should pass through the automatic checking machine; the red-colored tickets are to be shown to ticket inspectors and get pinched by a pair of ticket scissors. Put away your ticket(s) once checking has finished.</p>
  <p>At some railway stations, waiting sections are not divided. In that case, show this sentence to any station staff or passer-by, while showing your ticket(s), to find your waiting line:</p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>我搭乘这趟列车，请问我在哪里候车？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> wǒ dā    chéng zhè tàng liè chē, qǐng wèn wǒ zài nǎ lǐ hòu chē<br />
        (I am taking this    train; would you please tell me where the waiting section is?) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>5. Get onto the platform </h3>
  <p align="left">Under some circumstances, you may need to walk up and down stairs to get onto the platform. At some recently-built or renovated stations, escalators and elevators will make this walk easier. Unfortunately some train stations do not have an escalator or elevator therefore you may need to walk up and down stairs to get onto the platform. A LED screen will show the direction of your designated platform by highlighting the train number, indicating which stairs to walk down or which direction to go. </p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="567" height="274" src="howTo_clip_image011.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
  Unlike in Europe, boarding platforms in China don’t have gates. If you are traveling with children, keep an eye on them due to the large crowds. There may be a lot of pushing and shoving! </p>
    <p>There may well be trains on either side of a platform. Board the train with number matching your paper ticket. Ticket inspectors who stand by the gates of different cars will request a ticket check, but not an ID check. Double-check with the inspector if you are not sure it’s the right train.</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="560" height="247" src="howTo_clip_image013.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>6. Officially on board </h3>
  <p align="left">To <strong>find your designated car and seat</strong>, you will need to  check the details on your ticket. Below are a couple of examples, explaining how to read you ticket.</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="642" height="707" src="howTo_clip_image015.jpg" /> </p>
  <p align="left"><br />
  If you have large luggage, the first thing to do after boarding is to find a place for your stuff. There is luggage space at the connected parts of two carriages on a high speed train, which can store 2 to 4 suitcases on its two-leveled shelf. This public shelf cannot be reserved, but is available on a first-come-first-served basis. You can also stow luggage on the upper shelf beside your seat (see below), if the other public shelf is already full.</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    <img border="0" width="643" height="302" src="howTo_clip_image017.jpg" /></p>
  <p align="left"><br />
  Always keep valuables with you. You might need the sentences below when looking for your seat, or when wishing to swap seats with someone else:</p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        (1) <strong>请问我的座位在哪里？</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin:</strong> qǐng    wèn wǒ de    zuò wèi zài nǎ lǐ ? <br />
        (Where is my seat, please? (While showing    your tickets) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><p align="left">(2) <strong>对不起，我和我的同伴座位不在一起，请问你是否愿意和我们换一下座位？</strong> <br />
          <strong>Pinyin: </strong>duì bú qǐ, wǒ hé wǒ de tóng bàn zuò wèi bú zài yī qǐ, qǐng    wèn nǐ shì    fǒu    yuàn yì hé wǒ men    huàn yī xià zuò wèi ?<br />
          (Excuse me, my friends and I are in    separated seats, would you mind changing seats with us?) </p></td>

  <h2>Part-2 Travel tips </h2>
  <h3>1. Safety</h3>
  <p align="left">Traveling by train in China is fairly safe. However, as with traveling by air or barefoot, this advantage can be blunted if safety awareness is not a priority. Here are some tips for train safety. <br />
    (1) Be advised that you should always keep your belongings in view and never leave valuable items out in the open. Your cash, credit cards, travel documents and other important items should be separated and kept safe. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, a small amount of cash, perhaps 100RMB, will be more than enough for your needs on the train (e.g. food and other stuff). Have some small notes handy, so you don’t have to rummage in your bags or luggage.<br />
    (2) It is the adults’ job to restrain young kids from getting too excited about anything, for children may run around on the platform or in the carriage, or fiddle about with the bathroom doors or water faucet. <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally the stations don’t have special passages or boarding platforms for senior travelers, but it is unlikely that a senior will be jostled or pushed. Apart from on high-speed trains which travel smoothly, senior travelers may want to avoid walking around on the train, as sometimes harsh jarring or sudden braking can happen.<br/>
    
    (3) Tap water is not for drinking. Always drink bottled water or get water at the drinking pantry. Let your children know this before they ask for a drink. <br />
    (4)	Keeping your wits about you might be easy during the daytime or on short trips. On some overnight train rides, however, there is a chance that things might be stolen or lost.<br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the lock on your suitcase. If your bag or rucksack has a strap, clip it up onto the railing by the bunk or onto your arm before you go to sleep. This will wake you up if the bag or rucksack moves. Stash your money, cards and travel documents inside your jacket and zip it up. Of course, lock up the compartment if possible.
  </p>
 
 <h3>2. Luggage limits </h3>
  <p align="left">
In theory, the luggage limit on Chinese trains is 20 kg for adults and 10 kg for children. No one, however, weighs or measures your bags, so if your luggage goes through the security check, you'll be fine. If you really want to transport vast quantities of luggage, you can purchase baggage tickets for bags in excess of the official limits.
  </p>
  
 <h3>3. Red-cap porter service </h3>
  <p align="left"> 
  If you take heavy luggage or a big suitcase with you, you might want to find a red-cap porters at the train station to help you carry your luggage onto the train. Each piece will cost about 10 or 20 yuan.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Toilets</h3>
  <p align="left">All the regular non-high-speed trains are equipped with Japanese-style squat toilets, while all the high-speed trains have western-style loos. Bathrooms are located at both ends of every car.</p>
  <p>Note that toilets will be temporarily closed 10 minutes before the train reaches a station and during the time it stays there. So just go whenever nature calls, coz you don’t know when you’re going to reach a station. And there may be a long waiting line, too.</p>
  <p>On high-speed trains, used tissues and other trash should be put into the trash can. However, on non-high-speed ones, tissue and other trash can be flushed down by treading on a pedal. Always bring valuables with you. You can put them on the door hook while using the toilet.</p>
  <p>Bathrooms on high-speed trains have disposable paper seat cover and tissues. In the washroom, there is soap (or liquid soap) and paper for drying hands. Ask a steward for a refill if the paper is used up.</p>
  <p>None of these things is offered on regular non-high-speed trains. Be mentally prepared, for the squat toilets can be really nasty on some of the long-haul trains. Thus, a pack of baby wipes or hand sterilizer and some tissues should be amongst your baggage.</p>
  <p>Young kids and senior travelers are advised to have a guardian on hand when using the toilet. Senior travelers should use the hand railing inside the bathroom. And watch out for doors slamming and pinching fingers. Floors can be slippery, so watch your step and walk slowly.</p>
  <h3>5.  Preparing to disembark </h3>
  <p align="left">It is better to get ready in advance when the train is slowly pulling up at your destination. Ask for help from your steward. You can use this sentence: </p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="712" valign="top"><br />
        <strong>请在到站前</strong><strong>10</strong><strong>分钟提醒我准备下车，谢谢！</strong><strong> </strong><br />
        <strong>Pinyin: </strong>qǐng zài dào zhàn qián 10fèn zhōng tí xǐng wǒ zhǔn bèi    xià chē, xiè xiè!<br />
        (Please    remind me 10 minutes before arrive my destination, thanks!) </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Gather your stuff before getting off and don’t forget your ticket(s), because you will probably encounter another ticket check at the exit. </p>
  <h3>6. Helpful sentences </h3>
